# Groovy exercises

The following exercises are tagged with the level of difficulty:
* :star: : the solution follows from the resources given (lectures, videos, examples)   
* :star::star: : the solution may require browsing documentation in order to solve the problem 
* :star::star::star: the solution involves some challenge and it is likely that you will need to combine solutions from different units in order to solve the problem

Access the file `src/exercises.groovy` and implement the exercises:
- ex 01 (:star:). print "my name: 06-18-2016" on the output console using a GString (**output stream**)
- ex 02 (:star:). use a loop for printing the members of the following collection `["orange","banana","coconut"]` (**control structures**)
- ex 03 (:star:). define a function that given a range of integers, determines the average (**function, control structures**)
- ex 04 (:star::star:). using a closure check whether the variable `fruitBag` contains 'banana' (**closures**)
- ex 05 (:star::star:). using a closure check whether all the words in fruitBag contain the letter 'n' (**closures, API**)
